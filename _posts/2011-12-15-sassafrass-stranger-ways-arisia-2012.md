[**RSVP on Facebook for the Sunday show**][3]

[Sassafrass][4] is a Pegasus Award-nominated a cappella filk group who perform original pieces with complex vocal harmonies. Stranger Ways is a dark modern folk band that plays traditional and original music with heavy harmonies and a macabre sense of humor. Together, they fight crime. Also, perform music.

In the Saturday night concert, Stranger Ways and Sassafrass will perform alternating sets, including songs from Stranger Ways’s new album “Guilt, Angst & Fairy Tales,” and the two latest songs from Sassafrass’s “Sundown” album, both new to Arisia! Albums will be available for purchase at the show.

In a repeat performance on Sunday evening, Stranger Ways and Sassafrass will reprise some of the songs from the Saturday night show, and will also bring back some old favorites that we didn’t have time for in the Saturday night show.

NOTE: These shows take place at the Arisia convention, so you will need to purchase at least a day membership to attend. There will be plenty of other stuff to do throughout the day! We recommend buying your pass ahead of time! If you decide to buy same-day, be sure to show up early! More information at [2012.arisia.org][5]
