  When this song’s stuck in your head, and you want to kill us dead<br /> We’re judging you, we’re judging you<br /> Perhaps you should write a verse, but you think you’ll make it worse<br /> Write away, it’s OK<br /> But we’re judging you<br /> <em>        – Emily L</em>
</p>

*[I’m Judging You][1] has turned out to represent some universal experiences for our listeners.  Even before releasing the song, we had written a sizable number of alternate verses, and after we began performing it, fans started writing their own.  We’ve collected as many of them as we can here.*

**On boarding subways** - *by Diana Hsu*<br/>
When you’re waiting at the station with increasing consternation  
I’m judging you, I’m judging you  
When you try to shove on board, barging through the leaving horde  
You’re an ass – Let them pass  
I’m judging you.

**On cleaning up after pets** - *by Emily L*<br/>
When your dog craps on my lawn, I just wish that you’d be gone.  
I’m judging you, I’m judging you.  
Don’t you dare just walk away.  Use a plastic bag, okay?!  
It’s your pup.  Pick it up.  
I’m judging you.

**On conversational etiquette** - *by Emily L*<br/>
When you’re chatting with your friend and your listening you suspend,  
I’m judging you, I’m judging you.  
You won’t know what’s going on.  The directions will be gone.  
Take a look.  Where’s your book?!  
I’m judging you.

**On cyberchondria** – *by Alexandria Wilkie*<br/>
You have no medical degree, but you’ve bookmarked Web MD  
I’m judging you, I’m judging you  
Friends have caught every disease, you’re researching my last sneeze  
I’m quite well – go to hell!  
I’m judging you

**On dating people with poor taste in literature** (alternate bridge) - *by Shelley, Nat & Sandry*<br/>
When I go on OKCupid ’cause you messaged me today  
And your favorite books are Atlas Shrugged and Fifty Shades of Grey  
Yes, I know who fucking John Galt is, now please just go away  
Sleep with you? Please go screw.  
I’m judging you

**On drafty rooms** – *by Emily L*<br/>
When you whine that you are chilly in your shorts and t-shirt frilly  
I’m judging you, I’m judging you  
Suck it up and get a sweater, or a jacket – even better  
It’s December, just remember  
I’m judging you

**On filk** - *by Nat Budin and Kate Farb-Johnson*<br/> 
In the morning after three, fifteen verses, out of key  
I’m judging you, I’m judging you  
It’s my Enya Gundam filk – almost nothing rhymes with “filk”  
I mean there’s “ilk”… and “milk”  
I’m judging you

**On hipsters** - *by Jon Sagotsky*<br/>
Lumberjack mustache and beard; grandma glasses, looking weird.  
I’m judging you, I’m judging you  
Huge tattoo upon your chest, fixed speed bike like all the rest,  
Irony, douche neck tee.  
I’m judging you.

**On homework** - *by Emily L*<br/>
When you don’t proofread your work you are driving me berserk  
I’m judging you, I’m judging you  
You have mixed up “your” and “you’re,” and your grammar I deplore  
Comma splice, pay the price:  
I’m failing you.

**On household chores** – *by Alexandria Wilkie*  
Housemates wish you’d clean your room, have you never used a broom?  
I’m judging you, I’m judging you  
Mounds of clothes and dishes rise, you’re your own Lord of the Flies  
Hire a maid; you’re well-paid  
But I’m judging you

**On “I’m Judging You”** - *by Nat Budin*<br/>
Once I wrote a silly song, with this tune to sing along:  
“I’m judging you, I’m judging you”  
But I know I do half this shit – guess I’m just a hypocrite  
Crowds applaud, I’m a fraud  
I’m judging me

**On the intersection of mobile phones and retail** - *by Sharone H-H and Terry H*<br/>
In the grocery line you wait, on your phone expostulate<br/>
I'm judging you, I'm judging you<br/>
The cashier wants to ring you up, so your call she must disrupt<br/>
Don't get mad, that's just sad<br/>
And I'm judging you
