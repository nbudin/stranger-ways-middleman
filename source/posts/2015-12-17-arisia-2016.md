Murder Ballads is a duo of singer-songwriters playing an eclectic blend of folk, blues, and occasionally even murder ballads.  Stranger Ways is a dark folk/rock band that plays original and traditional music with a macabre sense of humor.  At Arisia 2016, they perform for the first time together.

[Murder Ballads](http://murder-ballads.com) consists of longtime musicians Catt Kingsgrave and Adam Fromm.  The duo released its first album, *Pretty in Scarlet*, in 2014 following a successful crowdfunding campaign and repeated three-hour commute between their homes, and recently appeared as the Music Guests of Honor at Philcon 2015.

[Stranger Ways](http://www.stranger-ways.com) formed in 2010 as a backing band for a party and accidentally continued to this day, releasing two albums along the way.  Currently, the group consists of Nat Budin, Kara Hurvitz, Jon Sagotsky, Brad Smith, and Alexandria Wilkie.  Stranger Ways is currently in the process of completing its epic folk-rock opera *Iron &amp; Rust.*
