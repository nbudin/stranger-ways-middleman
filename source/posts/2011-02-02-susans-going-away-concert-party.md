**Where:** The Bell Curve of Sin (393 Belmont St., Belmont, MA)  
**When:** Saturday, February 19, 2011 · 7:00pm  
[**RSVP on Facebook**][1]

Susan Weiner, our illustrious founder, composer, fiddler, and singer, has been offered a post-doctoral position at the University of Iowa. We’re going to see her off in style with a house concert, and we’ve invited some of our friends to perform as well.

Special guest performers will include [Sassafrass][2] and Madelaine Ripley.

We’ll also have copies of our album, [Strangers at the Gate][3], available for purchase there. Possibly albums from our special guests too, if they bring them!

Following the concert there will be a going away party for Susan: feel free to stay and send well-wishes and see her off before she moves to Iowa for a post-doc!
