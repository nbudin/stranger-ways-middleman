We'll be playing a house concert at Fractal House in Medford, showcasing our new *Iron &amp; Rust* material along with some of our old favorites.  We'd love to see you there!

Details from the house owner:

* If you know you will be attending, positive RSVPs are appreciated, so we can be sure to set up enough chairs.  (You can RSVP on Facebook, or email info@stranger-ways.com and we'll pass along the RSVP.)
* The address is 246 High St, Medford, MA. However, the house is on a shared driveway, so you can't see the house number from High Street. Look for the shared driveway opposite Essex St.
* Note to the mobility impaired: There are three steps up to the front door of the house. 
* Allergy-sufferers rejoice: the house has no pets.
* Children are welcome, but the house is *not* childproofed. 
* The 94 and 95 buses stop in front of the house. Other bus options include 96 (if you are willing to walk about 10 minutes),134 and 326.
* Parking is available. We can fit 6 cars in the driveway, if some are blocked in. Parking on High street is not recommended, but is allowed nearby on Essex St, Daly Rd, and W Schoolhouse Rd.
