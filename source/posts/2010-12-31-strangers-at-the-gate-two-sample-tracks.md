Hello everyone!  We’re currently putting the finishing touches on our album “Strangers at the Gate,” coming in mid-January.  The album will be available for purchase at [our upcoming concert at Arisia 2011][1], and online shortly thereafter.

In the meantime, we wanted to give you a preview of two of the songs on the album.  We’ve put up the new, improved version of “Cold Atlantic Shore” as well as our new translation and arrangement of the traditional ballad “Two Corbies.”
