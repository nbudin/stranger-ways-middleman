**Where:** [Arisia 2013][1] at the Westin Boston Waterfront, Boston, MA  
**When:** Saturday, January 19, 2013 · 12:00 – 2:00 pm

[RSVP on Facebook][2]

Dark folk group [Stranger Ways][3] and folk fantasy a capella group [Sassafrass][4] have each been working on new, ambitious concept albums, and both groups are excited to debut their latest material at Arisia!

**[Sundown: Whispers of Ragnarok][5]** is Sassafrass’s upcoming and long-awaited Norse-themed CD. The songs fit together to form a narrative, beginning with the creation of the world and dramatizing the disastrous consequences of the falling-out between the Allfather Odin and his blood-brother Loki. The lyrics and stories draw directly on the Prose Edda and Poetic Edda, the two oldest primary sources of Norse mythology.

    <strong>Iron and Rust</strong> is Stranger Ways’s upcoming “folk-rock opera.” It tells the story of a war between humans and the fae, those who try to stop it, and those who want victory at any cost. Adventure, tragedy, and a bit of twisted humor come together in the band’s most ambitious project to date!

  <p>
    The groups will perform alternating sets of selections from the new albums, old favorites, and a few surprises–come see the show, and spread the word!
