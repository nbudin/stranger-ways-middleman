Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling  
From glen to glen, and cross the mountain side  
The summer’s gone, and all the flowers are dying  
‘Tis you, ’tis you must go and I must bide.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  But come ye back when summer’s in the meadow<br /> Or when the valley’s hushed and white with snow<br /> ‘Tis I’ll be here in sunshine or in shadow<br /> Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so.
</p>

***Optional verse that we usually cut out:  
****In Derry Vale, amid the Foyle’s dark waters,  
**The salmon leap, beside the surging weir.  
**The seabirds call, I still can hear them calling  
**In night’s long dreams of those I hold so dear.*

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>Oh, tarrying years, fly faster, ever faster,</em><br /> <em> I long to see that vale belov’d so well,</em><br /> <em> I long to know that I am not forgotten,</em><br /> <em> And there in home I come in peace at last to dwell.</em>
</p>

*Instrumental break*

And if you come, when all the flowers are dying  
And I am dead, as dead I well may be  
You’ll come and find the place where I am lying  
And kneel and say an “Ave” there for me.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  And I shall hear, though soft ye tread above me<br /> And all my dreams will warm and sweeter be<br /> If you’ll not fail to tell me that you love me<br /> I’ll simply sleep in peace until you come to me
</p>
