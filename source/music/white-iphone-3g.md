Life is beautiful<br/>
But we only can enjoy it for a time<br/>
Some of us live for many years<br/>
But you were cut down in your prime

<p style="margin-left: 30px">
  And I’m sorry that we had to say goodbye<br/>
  And I’m sorry that you met this tragedy<br/>
  And I’m sorry that I couldn’t save your life that night<br/>
  I’m sorry that I lost you, my white iPhone 3G
</p>

You were the most loyal of friends<br/>
A constant companion of my own<br/>
You stayed by my side till the end<br/>
Even though you were just a phone

<p style="margin-left: 30px">
  And I’m sorry it was I that did you in<br/>
  And I’m sorry that you met this tragedy<br/>
  And I’m sorry that I couldn’t save your life that night<br/>
  I’m sorry that I killed you, my white iPhone 3G
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 60px">
  ’Twas a bitter cold night in New England<br/>
  And I had been up far too late<br/>
  Fell asleep on the couch with the TV still on<br/>
  And opened my eyes, half-awake
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 60px">
  My pants lay beside me in a pile on the couch<br/>
  A cup of milk sat on the chair<br/>
  And you, my poor iPhone, sat all by yourself<br/>
  How was I to get you upstairs?
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 60px">
  I groggily searched for ideas<br/>
  And figured a way to take you up<br/>
  I would carry my pants in my right arm<br/>
  And balance the phone atop the cup
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">
  And I’m sorry that I’m stupid when I’m sleepy<br/>
  And I’m sorry that I that I doze off from TV<br/>
  And I’m sorry that I don’t have a steadier hand<br/>
  I’m sorry that I drowned you, my white iPhone 3G
</p>
