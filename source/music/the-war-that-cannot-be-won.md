<p style="color: #606">
Two ancient enemies arrive here today<br/>
Your people praying for salvation <br/>
I’ve seen the madness and the vengeance in your eyes <br/>
That way leads to annihilation
</p>

<p style="color: #606; margin-left: 30px">
You’ve ignited the fuse, now you cannot but lose <br/>
You lead your own men into slaughter <br/>
When the battle is done, you will fall to the gun <br/>
The end is nigh, the war that cannot be won
</p>

<p style="color: #066">
Two ancient enemies have been kept apart <br/>
Their worlds completely separated <br/>
But over time the wall has been chipped away <br/>
The hedge between them desecrated
</p>

<p style="color: #066; margin-left: 30px">
It was better before you kicked open the door <br/>
We’ve proven we can’t live together <br/>
Separation a gift now destroyed by this rift <br/>
I’ve got to end this war that cannot be won
</p>

<p style="color: #066; margin-left: 60px">
Tom, if you're thinking that which I suspect you’re thinking <br/>
Then maybe there’s a way, but such a cost <br/>
Tom, if you're asking that which I suspect you’re asking <br/>
The power must arise from something lost
</p>

<p style="color: #606; margin-left: 60px">
Your queen could throw away a hundred thousand of my people <br/>
But for her that would be no sacrifice <br/>
The willing death of just one human holds more power <br/>
Than the slaughter she would use to pay the price
</p>

<p>
<span style="color: #066">
Two ancient enemies that met in the wood <br/>
And found their fates woven together<br/>
</span>
<span style="color: #606">
Until today I only cared for myself <br/>
So we can do your queen one better
</span>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">
<span style="color: #606">
Never thought that a friend would deliver my end <br/>
</span>
<span style="color: #066">
My virtue the death of my conscience <br/>
</span>
<span style="color: #006">
We must give human life to the will of the knife <br/>
</span>
<span style="color: #066">
To save us from the war that cannot
</span>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">
<span style="color: #606">
Be they human or fae, I will curse those I save <br/>
</span>
<span style="color: #066">
Our worlds must be parted forever <br/>
</span>
<span style="color: #006">
So now take up the blade, blood and tears will be paid <br/>
We won’t let you fight this war that cannot be won
</span>
