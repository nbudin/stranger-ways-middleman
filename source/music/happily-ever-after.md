I knew my prince would come someday  
The one who would carry me far away  
Away from the dreary everyday  
Happily ever after  
My prince found me at the junior dance  
Tuxedo jacket and denim pants  
I saw the future in his glance  
Happily ever after

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Love is a fairy tale<br /> Shining armor, dragon scale<br /> Leave behind a breadcrumb trail<br /> to happily ever after
</p>

He drove me home in his charger white  
The perfect end to the perfect night  
Rest in his arms till morning light  
Happily ever after  
He said “Won’t you come away with me  
I know a place where we’ll be free  
Away from your broken family  
to Happily ever after

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Love is a fairy tale<br /> Searching for a golden grail<br /> A sacred quest that’s doomed to fail<br /> Happily ever after
</p>

*Break*

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  So away to find a priest<br /> And once the revelry has ceased<br /> Every beauty must find her beast<br /> Happily ever after
</p>

We sat down to eat one dreadful night  
I dropped the wine, we had a fight  
A beast has claws and teeth that bite  
A dungeon in every castle  
My chains are made of one gold ring  
Still for him I’d do anything  
He may be a beast but he’s my king  
Happily ever after

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Love is a fairy tale<br /> Living in the sweetest jail<br /> Trapped behind thorns, growing pale<br /> Happily ever after
</p>
