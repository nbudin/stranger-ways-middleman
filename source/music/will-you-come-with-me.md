<pre><strong>Guitar chords </strong>
(Capo 2; song is in B minor, chord shapes written below)

Verse:  ||: Am      | Em      | C    G    | Am     :|| (x2)
Chorus: ||: D       | Am      | F    G    | Am     :|| (x2)</pre>

Verses are “woman” parts, until “you’ll never get me or you wouldn’t be here”, which is a chorus, and the final stanza, which is also a chorus, but which ends on A major.

**<span style="color: #ff0000;">Devil</span>  
<span style="color: #0000ff;">Woman </span>**

<span style="color: #0000ff;">A woman stood singing alone in her garden</span>  
<span style="color: #0000ff;">Singing songs sweet as the air</span>  
<span style="color: #0000ff;">She heard a sound, and when she turned around</span>  
<span style="color: #0000ff;">A beautiful devil was there</span>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <span style="color: #ff0000;">Will you come with me, oh won’t you come with me</span><br /> <span style="color: #ff0000;">The beautiful devil he cried</span><br /> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Will you come with me, oh won’t you come with me</span><br /> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Come rule in hell by my side</span>
</p>

<span style="color: #0000ff;">I swore to my mother I never would marry</span>  
<span style="color: #0000ff;">A man or a devil beside</span>  
<span style="color: #0000ff;">It won’t change a thing, be you devil or king</span>  
<span style="color: #0000ff;">I never will be no man’s bride</span>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <span style="color: #ff0000;">Will you come with me, oh won’t you come with me</span><br /> <span style="color: #ff0000;">I’ll drape you in jewels and in gold</span><br /> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Will you come with me, oh won’t you come with me</span><br /> <span style="color: #ff0000;">My palace is sweet to behold</span>
</p>

<span style="color: #0000ff;">I won’t have a man who is seeking to own me</span>  
<span style="color: #0000ff;">You bind me I’ll wither and die</span>  
<span style="color: #0000ff;">A chain made of gold is still made to hold</span>  
<span style="color: #0000ff;">A palace a cage to my eye</span>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <span style="color: #ff0000;">Will you come with me, oh won’t you come with me</span><br /> <span style="color: #ff0000;">I’ll feed you on sugars and sweets</span><br /> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Will you come with me, oh won’t you come with me</span><br /> <span style="color: #ff0000;">You’ll eat from the choicest of meats</span>
</p>

<span style="color: #0000ff;">There’s no fruit sweeter than what’s in my garden</span>  
<span style="color: #0000ff;">Hell’s sweets would be bitter to me</span>  
<span style="color: #0000ff;">The eggs from my hen are far choicer than</span>  
<span style="color: #0000ff;">Your meat could possibly be</span>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <span style="color: #ff0000;">The devil he turned and the devil he cursed her</span><br /> <span style="color: #ff0000;">How dare you refuse me, he said</span><br /> <span style="color: #ff0000;">The devil he turned and the devil he cursed her</span><br /> <span style="color: #ff0000;">I’ll wait until after you’re dead</span>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <span style="color: #0000ff;">Oh you’ll never get me or you wouldn’t be here</span><br /> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Why trade for what you’ll get for free?</span><br /> <span style="color: #0000ff;">I’ll tend my plants and I’ll take my chances</span><br /> <span style="color: #0000ff;">And after it’s over I’ll see</span>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <span style="color: #ff0000;">Will you come with me, oh won’t you come with me</span><br /> <span style="color: #ff0000;">The beautiful devil he said</span><br /> <span style="color: #0000ff;">The woman replied with a gleam in her eye</span><br /> <span style="color: #0000ff;">I’d rather go nowhere instead</span>
