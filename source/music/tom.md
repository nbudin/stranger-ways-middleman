It started like a lot of days, the sky was gray as my town <br/>
With a sound like a train the rain began to fall <br/>
I trudged along without a word, and ducked into the mall, <br/>
Which I blame, in part, for the drain that keeps this place tame

But freaks are here, and freaks peddle Dust <br/>
And Dust is what I want

Dealers and weirdos belong in the shadows, but these aren’t your usual fare. <br/>
Find the gaudiest neon glare and there they stare, <br/>
In rev’rent revelry; aware of something I can’t see <br/>
But will...

The deal is quick, and I score, and I soar, and finally relax <br/>
Hallelujah for the fae! Buck up, little guys, your loss has made my day

And now the rain is colorful, and even this town makes sense <br/>
I can hear every stone down in my bones and they all scream, ‘Get thee hence!’ <br/>
‘Quicken your pace! Leave this place before it sucks you dry.’ <br/>
So I wandered deep into the woods at the edge of the town

If Mama knew, she’d be so afraid <br/>
But I was beyond fear

And then I saw the craziest thing <br/>
I wasn’t alone, somebody was singing! <br/>
Somebody else as hazed up as me <br/>
pranced and sang to an old willow tree

Well hell, this day just keeps getting better <br/>
I’m not the only one out here unfettered <br/>
I laughed and I joined in the crazy dance <br/>
Feeling too good to not take a chance

I thought “Maybe I’ll hate myself in the morning <br/>
But I’ll do that regardless, so why be boring”? <br/>
I walked right up to that willow tree <br/>
What fools, what fools we mortals be
