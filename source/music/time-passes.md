Head in the grass, surrounded by flowers<br/>
Sun in my face, clouds above me<br/>
Sleeping for days or just a few hours<br/>
I can't remember the last time I felt so free

Time to get up, time to get going<br/>
Time to return to my family<br/>
Feels like so long, but I'm happy knowing<br/>
That I'm going home, finally

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Passing the clearing by the stream where the woods end<br/>
  Why is that hill no longer green?  Home is just around the bend<br/>
  That cottage up the road seems much bigger than before<br/>
  The path turns smooth and black; my home is not there anymore
</p>

I woke up somewhere and I don't know when<br/>
Almost familiar, but how long has it been?<br/>
Is this a nightmare or could it be true?<br/>
What kind of twisted fate have I fallen into?<br/>
So many people in one place, how can it be?<br/>
I woke up somewhere and I don't know when

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  This is not my time; this is not my home<br/>
  Cut off from my line, now I'm all alone<br/>
  But I guess I'm here to stay in this place<br/>
  I woke up somewhere and I don't know when
</p>

I woke up somewhere and I don't know when<br/>
Good morning Desmond, where have you been?<br/>
Is this a nightmare or could it be real?<br/>
Well, how could anybody know how I feel?<br/>
And all the people I once knew, they’re all dead<br/>
I woke up somewhere and I don’t know when

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Have you heard the news?  I’m not from your time<br/>
  Though I feel confused, I’ve made up my mind<br/>
  But there will come a day, I’ll have my revenge<br/>
  I woke up somewhere and I don’t know when
</p>

I woke up somewhere and I don’t know when<br/>
Well, it might take a year - it might take ten<br/>
I’ll take this nightmare and I’ll make it mine<br/>
It was too cruel to take a kid from his time<br/>
They won’t get away with this; they’ll rue the day<br/>
I woke up somewhere and I don’t know when<br/>
I woke up somewhere and I don’t know when
