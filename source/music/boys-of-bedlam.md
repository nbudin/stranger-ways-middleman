For to see mad Tom of Bedlam  
Ten thousand miles I’d travel  
Mad Maudlin goes on dirty toes  
For to save her shoes from gravel

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Chorus:</strong><br /> Still I sing bonnie boys, bonnie mad boys<br /> Bedlam boys are bonnie,<br /> For they all go bare and they live by the air<br /> And they want no drink nor money
</p>

I went down to Satan’s kitchen  
For to get me food one morning  
And there I got souls piping hot  
All on the spit a-turning

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Chorus</strong>
</p>

Me staff has murdered giants  
And me bag a long knife carries  
For to cut mince pies from children’s thighs  
With which to feed the fairies

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Chorus</strong>
</p>

***Optional verse, which we only started doing at Arisia 2012:***  
*The spirits, white as lightning  
Will on me travels guide me  
The moon will quake and the stars will shake  
Whenever they espied me*

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em> <strong>Chorus</strong></em>
</p>

For to see mad Tom of Bedlam  
Ten thousand years I’d travel  
Mad Maudlin goes on dirty toes  
For to save her shoes from gravel
