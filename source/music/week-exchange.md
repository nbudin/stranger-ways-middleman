  <strong>Chorus:</strong><br /> I’d like to trade this week in<br /> It didn’t suit my needs one bit<br /> Only had it a week, it’s already wearing thin<br /> And I’m pretty sure it never really fit
</p>

Monday wasn’t bad, but it was Monday  
Tuesday, well, it rained the whole day long  
Wednesday, I’d trade in for any one day  
Where any ten fewer things went wrong

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Chorus </strong>
</p>

I could never get the hang of Thursdays  
And Friday I can’t say that things improved  
Saturday, I know that I’ve had worse days  
As Sunday most assuredly proved

  <strong>Chorus (repeat last line)</strong>
