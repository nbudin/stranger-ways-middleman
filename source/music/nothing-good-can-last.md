**Watch it:** <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4SuQy2TR0" target="_blank">Fractal House concert</a>

I took a walk down by the stream today <br/>
I sat alone and let time just slip away <br/>
There was a path here winding through the wood <br/>
I used to play there, but now it’s gone for good

I met a stranger there who looked like me <br/>
But then he showed me how cruel the world could be <br/>
My friend is gone now, but the Rift is too <br/>
I wonder is this really what he had to do?

<p style="margin-left: 30px">
  But now I know that it’s part of our nature <br/>
  Doesn’t matter how we try <br/>
  I know that nothing good can last, and we are why
</p>

Could we have found a way to coexist? <br/>
Why wonder now that it’s over, chances missed? <br/>
Are we that different from them after all? Or why did <br/>
He need to die to build this wall?

<p style="margin-left: 30px">
  But it was time, there was just no solution <br/>
  Didn’t matter how we tried <br/>
  I know that nothing good can last, and we are why
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 60px">
  They said the world was ours, and we believed <br/>
  For all our hubris, what did we achieve? <br/>
  Now we have a world all to ourselves, and nothing more
</p>

And they a world of rust and iron won, <br/>
If both had looked to the future, what could we have done? Instead we <br/>
Fought over grudges back to ancient times <br/>
Drunken on old mem’ries that had aged like wine

<p style="margin-left: 30px">
  And I have learned history can be poison <br/>
  It enthralls us in its spell <br/>
  So maybe "nothing good can last" is just as well
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">
  We gods of old and we youthful rivals <br/>
  Pray these words outlive ourselves <br/>
  Our story’s done, but not alone upon the shelves
</p>
