**Watch it:** <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfXvzxtShps" target="_blank">Fractal House concert</a>

“Hey now get your hands off me!” / “What is this supposed to be?” <br/>
“Stop! You’re hurting me” <br/>
“Hey now, where you taking me?” and then I begin to see <br/>
Oh, please no not this

There’s a Rift not far from here, what they intend is crystal clear <br/>
I’m dead to them now. Might as well <br/>
Toss me into faerieland, let me suffer at their hands <br/>
And laugh all the while

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  I’ll be kicked out of my home, left here all alone <br/>
  I’m thrown by my fortune to places unknown <br/>
  I’m shunned by my race, kicked out on my face <br/>
  They left me to die in disgrace
</p>

Will my mother shed a tear if I don’t get out of here? <br/>
Please don’t forget me <br/>
How could they have been so cruel; how could I be such a fool <br/>
Why did I set them free?

Spent my life believing they were nothing but deceiving fae <br/>
We paid them in kind, but when she <br/>
Found out what I really was, terrified of me because <br/>
Oh! I’ve been so blind

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  And just what did I think my new friend would infer <br/>
  When she found I'd consumed other folk just like her? <br/>
  She ran and was caught, I couldn’t stand by <br/>
  But now for my troubles am I gonna die?
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  They started it first, yes they started this fight <br/>
  So why should they care if I tried to do right? <br/>
  I’ve heard all the tales, what they’ve done to good men <br/>
  So why do I feel like I’d do it again?
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  I’m kicked out of my home, in the fae realm, alone <br/>
  To follow my conscience to places unknown <br/>
  She ran away; should I do the same? <br/>
  If I try to talk then will I get the blame for it all?
</p>
