  <strong>Chorus:</strong><br /> I don’t want to leave you, I just wanna stay<br /> You are my life but my work is calling me away<br /> But always remember, wherever I roam<br /> Wherever you are, wherever I find you, there’s my home
</p>

I go to a party and I see you there  
Intelligent eyes, interesting talk, beautiful hair  
Can we make some music or talk for awhile?  
Show me love me, show me I’m home, show me a smile

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Chorus</strong>
</p>

You are my GM team, you are my band  
When I make bad jokes, when I tell my stories, you understand  
My chosen family, the ones I hold dear  
Wherever I go, wherever I wind up, my heart is here

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Chorus (repeat last line 2x)</strong>
