<p>
Once there was a time for laughter<br/>
Once there was a time for play <br/>
But there must come a time when we must draw the line <br/>
Because that time is over today
</p>

<p>
Once there was a time for faeries <br/>
And magic, and wonder, and lore <br/>
But we must take a stand to defend human land <br/>
Because now it is the time for war
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">
  I have come to raise the alarm <br/>
  We must stand, hold the line, take up arms <br/>
  We shall not yield to our enemy <br/>
  We are strong, we are proud, we are free
</p>

<p>
So god damn all sprites, elves and faeries <br/>
And god damn the songs that they sing <br/>
We’ll pillage their homes and we’ll smash their queen’s throne <br/>
And we’ll burn down the faery ring <br/>
</p>
</div>

<div style="color: #060">
<p>
The world once was young and all faeries were one <br/>
We fae and our magic were free <br/>
But you beast-men instead, clumsy and overbred, <br/>
Have taken the world from me
</p>

<p>
Lurking in every dark alley <br/>
Waiting, we’ve always been here <br/>
Complacent no more, here to settle the score <br/>
We are your deepest fear
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">
  Come, my friends! Let us stand as one <br/>
  The dawn of the fae has begun <br/>
  The world’s ablaze, by our magic, rise <br/>
  On this night, by the sword mankind dies
</p>

<p>
Ready for battle, my legions <br/>
Take back the world for the fae <br/>
Together we’ll fight, we will triumph this night <br/>
We’ll right the world gone astray <br/>
</p>
</div>

<div style="color: #006">
<p>
Join me in glorious battle <br/>
Together we will make them pay <br/>
We'll take none alive and our people will thrive <br/>
They’ll not live to rue the day <br/>
</p>

<p>
You know our cause is righteous <br/>
You know our faith is true <br/>
We must now stop their lot; kill them all; let them rot <br/>
They'd do no less to you <br/>
</p>
</div>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">
  <span style="color: #600">
  Curse the fae! They will steal your kin <br/>
  In return they will burn for their sin <br/>
  </span>
  <span style="color: #060">
  Curse all men! They’re our world’s decline <br/>
  Prove your worth and the earth shall be thine <br/>
  </span>
</p>

<div style="color: #006">
<p>
March through the rift on my order <br/>
My friends, we are destined to win <br/>
Our triumph draws near; we will teach them to fear <br/>
Let their destruction begin
</p>
</div>
