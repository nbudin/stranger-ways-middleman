My grandpa says he’s only seventeen  
At eighteen they shipped him off to war  
Now if he stays always seventeen  
They can’t do that anymore

My grandpa he doesn’t breathe too well  
He takes medicines and takes his time  
He says that once breathe the fires of hell  
Your lungs will never trust you down the line

My grandpa says he’s only seventeen  
At eighteen they shipped him off to war  
Now if he stays always seventeen  
They can’t do that anymore
