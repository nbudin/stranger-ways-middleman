When you tell that stupid joke about the rabbi and the Pope  
Puns fall flat, what *was* that?  
Though it’s awkward, don’t you fuss, happens to the best of us  
I fail too; yes, it’s true  
But I’m judging you

When you honk and flash your brights, then you pass me on the right  
I’m judging you, I’m judging you  
In a mile I’ll see you stopped, getting chewed out by a cop  
Couldn’t wait, now you’re late  
I’m judging you

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Chorus<br /> </strong>It’s a hard and lonely world out there, we all deserve a break<br /> And no one should have to answer for their every last mistake<br /> And true friendship can be rare, it seems politeness is so fake<br /> But I swear, I’ll be there<br /> Judging you
</p>

When you speak of Mother Earth, chart the star signs of your birth  
I’m judging you, I’m judging you  
Crystals that can heal your knee, classes to unblock your chi  
Magic tea, phone reiki  
I’m judging you

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Bridge (chorus tune)</strong><br /> When you’re in the supermarket and you’re yelling at your child<br /> You don’t think that I can hear you, cause there’s no one in the aisle<br /> But your dignity is crumbling as I hear him running wild<br /> Turning red, hang your head<br /> We’re all judging you
</p>

When you tweet about your food, your ex-boyfriend or your mood  
I’m judging you, I’m judging you  
When you’re writing fic all day, Voldemort slash George Takei  
You’re not eight, punctuate  
Anyway, I’m judging you

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>Last chorus – repeat last line:</em><br /> Yes my friend, till the end<br /> I’ll be judging you
</p>
