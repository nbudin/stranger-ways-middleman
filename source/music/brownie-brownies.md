**Watch it:** <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA06YxKkCho" target="_blank">Fractal House concert</a>

If you wanna taste some magic<br/>
If you wanna feel a rainbow<br/>
Then kids I've got the ticket<br/>
to take you where you wanna go

LSD you say, that’s so yesterday<br/>
This robs heroin of its kick<br/>
There's only one way to make the cool kids sway<br/>
and that's a little baking trick

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Put some brownies in your brownies<br/>
  They're like chocolate mixed with hope<br/>
  Put some brownies in your brownies<br/>
  See? It just got easier to cope
</p>

First you see the sparkles, then a kind of smoke<br/>
It smells like terror, feels like color and makes you want to choke<br/>
But then the veil will part, and you will see with brand new eyes<br/>
You’ll hear the trees discuss the birds and the bees, and greet each butterfly<br/>

And when you start to come down, it’s like waking from a dream<br/>
but I’ve got good news, you don’t have to lose, ‘cause you’re on the winning team<br/>
The fae are like a plague, but that’s no reason to dismay<br/>
We’ll make the most of it, save some lemons, and use them for lemonade

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Put some selkie in your smoothie<br/>
  Put some banshee in your blow<br/>
  It’s got faerie it’s got dairy<br/>
  it will make your insides glow
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  Bake ‘em in the oven, alone or by the dozen<br/>
  It’s not wrong, because they can’t feel pain<br/>
  Then grind them into flakes, that’s really all it takes<br/>
  And sprinkle plenty on your coffee and your cakes
</p>

Remember, they’d do the same to you<br/>
Do the same to you

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  So put some boggan in your noggin<br/>
  Put some dryad in your drink<br/>
  Then just sit back and relax, and you<br/>
  Won’t even have to think
</p>
