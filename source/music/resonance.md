I wake up in an unfamiliar bed  
The dark confusion clearing from my head  
And I feel that you are near me  
And I hope, hope you won’t fear me  
Cause I know that you can hear me  
In your mind

You stand before me hanging by a thread  
By every right I think I should be dead  
Who are you? I don’t remember  
Who am I? I don’t remember  
Where are we? I don’t remember  
Anything

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Chorus</strong><br /> Oh, this resonance between us<br /> Searing from your eyes into my brain<br /> Our connection that I’m feeling<br /> The one thing that protects me from the pain
</p>

And as I stare into your eyes I see  
The distant flicker of a memory  
Then I hear the turning of keys and  
Then I fall down on my knees and  
Then I know we both know the reason  
Why we’re here

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Chorus</strong>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  When we open up the door and stare out, blinded by the sun<br /> Will we revel in our triumph or atone for what we’ve done?<br /> When our vision clears will you recall the world that I once knew<br /> Or is it all some fairy tale to you?
</p>

My life, my friends, my work, my family  
Becoming nothing now but history  
Won’t resist when they come to kill me  
For the dark future that will be  
For I know that I am guilty  
Of it all

  <strong>Chorus (last line 3x)</strong>
