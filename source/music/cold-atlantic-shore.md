  <em>Intro – chorus chords, very slow</em><br /> No tears, no tears my love<br /> No tears should you shed for me<br /> No tears, no tears my love<br /> When my body rises from the sea
</p>

The first time that I met you, your hair framed your face  
Like the halo of an angel in that dreary hell of a place  
And when our eyes first met, you stole away my heart  
The day you said you would be mine, I swore nothing would tear us apart

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Chorus:</strong><br /> No tears, no tears my love, no tears should you shed for me<br /> No tears no tears my love when my body rises from the sea<br /> No tears, no tears my love for you were the one who left me
</p>

I knew that you were leaving half a year from when we met  
I told you I would take every moment I could get  
I said that if you’d let me I would follow in your ways  
When you told me yes, I didn’t touch the ground for days

The months we spent together were like heaven come to earth  
There was more comfort in your arms than I had known since birth  
I dreaded the day you’d leave the time I’d spend alone  
But I knew that in the end I’d have you for my own

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Chorus</strong>
</p>

With every letter that you sent you told me how you longed  
To have me there beside you but I know now they were wrong  
Every time I saw you there was distance in your eyes  
And the reasons that you gave to me were excuses and lies

*Instrumental break*

  <strong>Chorus</strong>
</p>

In the end I pried it out three weeks from when I came  
You told me I had lost your heart things would not be the same  
You swore that you loved me still, but said that we must part  
Well darling if you loved me, you would leave me with my heart

So I make you no promises of what I plan to do  
As long as you have my heart I never will leave you  
This creaky dock is writhing from the cold Atlantic Shore  
And if you’ve heard this song, I’m not sitting here<sup>*</sup> no more
