Oh, a merry fae went wandering to see what lay outside, <br/>
and I know this tale is true because that merry fae was I. <br/>
They say that magic’s dead beyond the hedge’s hidden walls <br/>
But I think that wonder doesn’t die, it hides when shadows fall. <br/>
And wondrous are the places deep and hidden I will find <br/>
For I’m sure I’ve but to listen and the earth will hum in kind

They have tried to tell me do not go, for badly I will fare, <br/>
they may be right, I’ve heard about the men that rule out there <br/>
They say they're taking those who stray too far and aren't smart <br/>
They’re vile, voracious, vicious things with iron in their hearts <br/>
Oh, these tales are so exciting! Did they think I’d be afraid? <br/>
...well maybe just a little, but I won’t be scared away.

I've always wanderlusted; I will take hold of my fate <br/>
for how much worth is safety when you’re stuck behind a gate? <br/>
And so I went a-wandering, to see what lay outside, <br/>
and I sang with crickets and starlings, even made the old willow sigh. <br/>
This world is just as wondrous as I knew that it could be; <br/>
So many creatures big and small to greet, befriend, and see… <br/>

I’m glad I went a-wandering and meandered down the path <br/>
That rambles through these woods without a sign of iron wrath<br/>
Perhaps I will find dangers still within the realm of men <br/>
But I can’t seem to believe that; all this world's a peaceful glen <br/>
But lo, what's this I merry see? A figure further down <br/>
Infused with magic just like me; this must be kin I've found! <br/>
Oh joy to have found suddenly a fellow fae as free as me! <br/>
The stories we’ll share of how we’ve fared will become history!
