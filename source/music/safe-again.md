It’s over  
It’s been over for years  
Past the angry accusations  
Past the painful memories and tears

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Chorus:</strong><br /> And it’s safe again, hold me tight<br /> We weren’t made for forever, we were made for tonight<br /> And everything is gonna be all right<br /> If we leave before the morning light
</p>

I was careless  
You were clingy, you were needy  
You turned into a chore  
I got smothered, I got greedy

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Chorus</strong>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  <strong>Bridge:</strong><br /> I remember falling in love with you<br /> It was never what I meant to do<br /> I met you at a temporary place<br /> And I fell for your body, your hair, your face
</p>

You’re beautiful, I can’t keep my hands away  
And I’d love to spend some time with you, just please don’t ask me to stay

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Chorus</strong> (repeat last line 2x)
</p>
