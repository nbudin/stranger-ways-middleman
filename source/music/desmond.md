<div style="color: #060">
There once was a boy, a boy they called Desmond<br/>
Charming and brave with a happy young life<br/>
He lived in a village not too far from here<br/>
The son of an old preacher man and his wife

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  He wanted for nothing, he knew he was loved<br/>
  But there comes a time when a boy wants to climb<br/>
  That tree a bit higher, to pick through that briar<br/>
  To stray from his home and to see the world for himself
</p>

He took an old compass his father had earned<br/>
When he was at sea when he, too, longed to be<br/>
A gallant adventurer, exploring the world<br/>
When the lad left home, his parents despaired

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  His father called out, "the woods are not safe<br/>
  Now do as you're told and don't stray from the road<br/>
  Don't give your poor mother a fright; there are demons at night<br/>
  They're seductive as sin!", but he did not heed
</p>

Now I think you all know what happens next<br/>
Poor Desmond was taken, enthralled to the fae<br/>
And there he remained as a slave far beyond<br/>
The mercy that should have been his dying day

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  The thing about fae is they aren't quite cruel<br/>
  They just don't know pleasure and pain like we do<br/>
  And we are just playthings, like bugs in a jar<br/>
  As poor Desmond cries out, but his voice doesn't carry far
</p>

<div style="color: #600">
Show me the way out of here<br/>
The plea grows hollow, as hope is killed by fear<br/>
I see the others taken like me<br/>
See them forget that they once were free... not me

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Cling, cling, cling to my memories<br/>
  My poor dad must worry over me<br/>
  He looked like - oh no, not this again<br/>
  Must hold on - the stubble on his chin<br/>
  Eyes were brown - this is my litany<br/>
  Hair was white - you won't take him from me
</p>

My will alone gives me a chance<br/>
But drives me mad; it's the only way to dance<br/>
When you are bound by hands and your feet<br/>
And then it's clear as reason retreats

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  This magic - I start to understand<br/>
  Poisonous, but woven too the land<br/>
  My compass - how did I never see<br/>
  How it glows with all this energy<br/>
  Channel it - my will to do them harm<br/>
  Show me the way
</p>

The needle starts to turn<br/>
The needle starts to turn<br/>
The needle starts to turn<br/>
I'll make their kingdom burn
