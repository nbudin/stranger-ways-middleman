We can’t publish the lyrics for copyright reasons, but Escape Key has posted lyrics and chords <a href="http://cyphertext.net/escapekey/NeverBeen.txt" target="_blank">on their web site</a>.

We play it a little differently than Escape Key does: it’s transposed to A minor rather than D minor, and we go to to the relative major (C if you’re transposing it like we do, or F if you’re playing it in D minor) for the third chord in verse lines 1, 3, 5, and 7.  In other words, go to the relative major on “aging movie”, “old blue gingham”, “if I still can”, and “deep, try to”, and the same places on subsequent verses.  Despite the chord alteration, the melody is the same as in the original version.

In addition, in the bridge, we go to the minor IV chord (D minor if you’re transposing it like us, or G minor if you’re playing it in D minor like Escape Key) for the first half of lines 1, 2, and 3.  Just as in the verse, the melody stays the same as in the original version.
