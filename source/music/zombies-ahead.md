In Austin, Texas one morning  
The residents woke to a scare  
Road signs were giving the warning  
That the new invasion was there

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Chorus 1:</strong><br /> Zombies ahead!<br /> Zombies ahead!<br /> Pack up your jerky and run<br /> Zombies ahead!<br /> Zombies ahead!<br /> Zombies coming in from Highway 1
</p>

Zombies are driving in humvees  
Zombies are running red lights  
Zombies are talking on cell phones  
Zombies don’t use their lights at night!

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  <strong>Bridge:</strong><br /> In Austin, watch out on the street<br /> ‘Cause you don’t know what you might meet<br /> That jerk creeping past in the right lane<br /> Is really just cruising for brains!<br /> <em>(Brains, brains, brains…)</em>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Chorus 2:</strong><br /> Zombies ahead!<br /> Zombies ahead!<br /> Pack up your chainsaw and run<br /> Zombies ahead!<br /> Zombies ahead!<br /> Zombies coming in from Highway 1
</p>

I’ve heard they’ve spread out from Austin  
A plague spreading from sea to sea  
I’ve heard they’re coming to Boston  
So the next one you see could be me!

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Chorus 3:</strong><br /> Zombies ahead!<br /> Zombies ahead!<br /> Pack up your left arm and run <em>(and run!)</em><br /> Zombies ahead!<br /> Zombies ahead!<br /> Zombies coming in from Highway 1<br /> Zombies coming in from Highway 1
