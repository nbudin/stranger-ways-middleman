As all alone one night I walked  
I saw two ravens, how they talked  
One raven two the other did say  
“Where shall we go and dine today?  
Where shall we go and dine today?

I know the place a soldier fell  
A man of honor, mark it well  
And no one knows that he lies there,  
But his hawk, his hound and his lady fair  
His hawk, his hound and his lady fair

His hound has gone to hunt alone,  
His hawk to fetch the wild-fowl home,  
His lady’s found another mate,  
So we may have our dinner date  
So we may have our dinner date

You’ll dine upon his meaty thighs,  
And I’ll peck out his hazel eyes;  
With one lock of his golden hair  
We’ll thatch our nest when it grows bare  
Thatch our nest when it grows bare

Many a one for him will cry,  
But no one knows where he does lie;  
O’er his bones, once they’re picked clean  
The lonesome wind shall wail and keen  
The lonesome wind shall wail and keen”
